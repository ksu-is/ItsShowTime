Stupidly copied a different readme over mine.  It overwrote it, naturally.  History shows commits, at least.

For now, have flashed motioneyeos onto 64GB microSDXC card.  Initial install to RaspPi 4B seems to be successful. Need to physcially install camera to see if it will function

Otherwise, MotioeyeOS is easily connected through a separate computer and browser.  

Starting over with new README, logs aren't accurate but commit history may help fill in the gaps if needed.
Haven't really done anything of value yet.
RaspPi4b physically setup and operating fine
MotioneyeOS sems to work so far
Need to install camera and play follow video
Seem to only need an hr of total setup and configuration
Need to understand how to use the wireless network
It is currently hardwired through an ethernet cable, it is inconveniently located at the moment.
