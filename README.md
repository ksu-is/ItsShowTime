##Making a Rasp Pi Into Security Camera## ##10/27/20 7:10PM (MicroCenter)##

Purchased a Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB and Raspberry Pi Camera V2 Will aseemble it and get it running

Next step turn it into a security camera Perhaps add wifi enabled IoT motion sensor to trigger camera

Intitial setup, physcial layout (Complete)

Setup RaspPi 4B 4GB (Complete)

Initialize RaspPi (Complete)
    Initial attempt at running main.py presented with Syntax errors.( )
    Will have to review video and READMESecurityCamera. ( )
    Some keys will have to be changed for my credentials and email  ( )
    
Install RaspPi camera V2 module

Will need to obtain higher capacity SD card than what came in the kit (16GB).

Install and config OpenCV (Very arduous and long process)
Install and config Security Camera Code from HackerShackOfficial

   Install and config OpenCV obtained from https://qengineering.eu/install-opencv-4.4-on-raspberry-pi-4.html
   Security Camera Code Obtained from https://github.com/HackerShackOfficial/Smart-Security-Camera

Open CV will take about 2-4 hrs to compile and install.  Most of the setup is new to me because of never having worked with a rasp pi before or linux/unix.  It may be worth looking for an alternative to the opencv issue if there is one.  Maybe a simpler set of code than previously found.  
This site has a full mostly update set of instructions to install opencv

Make sure to obtain a much larger SD card than came with the rasp pi 4b kit.  came with a 16 GB, recommended is 32.
Check to see capacity limits for rasp pi for SD size.

MAke a copy of current clean SD OS install.
Install OpenCV or proceed with alternative when found


Found an alternative that may be simpler to install and operate.
