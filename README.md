Stupidly copied a different readme over mine.  It overwrote it, naturally.  History shows commits, at least.

For now, have flashed motioneyeos onto 64GB microSDXC card.  Initial install to RaspPi 4B seems to be successful. Need to physcially install camera to see if it will function

Otherwise, MotioeyeOS is easily connected through a separate computer and browser.
