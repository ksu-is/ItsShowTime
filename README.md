Copied a different readme over mine.  It overwrote it, naturally.  History shows commits, at least.

For now, have flashed motioneyeos onto 64GB microSDXC card.  Initial install to RaspPi 4B seems to be successful. Need to physcially install camera to see if it will function

Use this tutuorial or the book that came with the kit for camera installation

Unfortunately, it is an ugly physcial setup for the camera because the case is not designed for it
Have to take the top of the case off to operate the camera

Otherwise, MotioeyeOS is easily connected through a separate computer and browser.  

Starting over with new README, logs aren't accurate but commit history may help fill in the gaps if needed.

RaspPi4b physically setup and operating fine

MotioneyeOS sems to work so far

Need to install camera and follow video

Seem to only need an hr of total setup and configuration

Need to understand how to use the wireless network

It is currently hardwired through an ethernet cable, it is inconveniently located at the moment.

Refer to this site for instructions and image for OS https://dronebotworkshop.com/motioneyeos-raspberry-pi/

Wireless config doesn't seem to work yet, but wired is fine for now.

Camera works fine and streams through local internet to a local IP.  

MotionEYEOS img file is too large to copy to main branch, but forking source only goes to ksu-is/motioneyeos or to bdobson5/ItsShowTime.  The Wiki from source contains the various updates for newer gens of rasp pi. https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneyeos/wiki/Supported-Devices

Next step is to config for motion capture and video of capture event?

Storage space on microSD should be fine for tests. 64GB

Clean up README and Roadmap and prepare for PPT and presentation.

Figure out how to record screens and audio input for presentation.
